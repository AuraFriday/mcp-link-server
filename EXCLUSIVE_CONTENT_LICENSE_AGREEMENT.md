# Exclusive Content License Agreement

This Exclusive Content License Agreement ("Agreement") governs all content, including software, tools, plugins, recipes, or other digital works ("Content") you ("Licensor") submit for distribution on the mcp-link server platform ("the Store"), operated by Aura Friday ("the Company", "we", "us").

By submitting Content, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement.

### 1. Grant of Exclusive License
In consideration for the potential to earn royalties as set forth in the [Aura Friday Royalty Policy](ROYALTY_POLICY.md), you hereby grant to the Company an **exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-bearing license** to use, host, store, copy, distribute, perform, display, publish, sublicense, modify, and create derivative works from the Content in connection with the operation of the Store and any related services.

This exclusivity means you may not, directly or indirectly, license, sell, distribute, or make the Content available on any other platform or through any other means.

### 2. Your Representations and Warranties
You represent and warrant that:-
  - a. The Content is your own original creation, and you have the full legal right and authority to grant the license described in Section 1.
  - b. The Content does not infringe upon the copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or any other proprietary right of any third party.
  - c. The Content does not contain any malware, spyware, security vulnerabilities, viruses, or other malicious or harmful code.
  - d. You have taken all reasonable steps to ensure the safety, security, and stability of the Content for end-users.

### 3. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its parent and affiliate entities, and its officers, directors, and employees from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from any breach of your representations and warranties in Section 2.

### 4. Platform Rights and Discretion
You acknowledge that the Company is the platform operator and retains sole and absolute discretion over all content. We reserve the right to:-
  - a. Review, test, and audit any submitted Content for any length of time.

### 5. Compensation
Licensor’s compensation is governed entirely by the terms set forth in the **Aura Friday Royalty Policy**, which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement. The Company may update the Royalty Policy from time to time with notice. Your continued submission of Content or acceptance of royalties after such a change constitutes your agreement to the new policy.

### 6. Inter-User Disputes
You acknowledge that the Company is a platform provider and is not responsible for policing or mediating disputes between users of the Store. You agree that the Company has no liability for any end-user's misuse of your Content.

### 7. Governing Law
