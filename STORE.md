# The mcp-link-server Plugin Store: Sell Your AI Tools and Plugins

Welcome, creators! The mcp-link-server Plugin Store is a marketplace designed to turn your expertise into real-world AI capabilities. This is where you can sell or share MCP server tools, plugins, and integrations—the components that allow AI agents to perform powerful local operations, from file management to system automation.

Our vision is to build a community that crowdsources the intelligence for millions of users and AIs. Your work is a critical part of making hard things easy.

### How It Works: From Idea to Royalty

We've designed a straightforward process for getting your tools and plugins into the hands of users.

1.  **Propose Your Tool/Plugin:** Start by opening an issue to discuss your idea. This ensures your work aligns with our platform's needs and security standards. The process is detailed in our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

2.  **Build & Test:** Craft your tool or plugin, focusing on efficiency, reliability, and most importantly, security. Test it thoroughly with the MCP server framework.

3.  **Submit for Security Review:** Once complete, you will submit your tool/plugin for a mandatory security audit by our team. We vet every submission to protect our users and maintain the integrity of the ecosystem.

4.  **Agree to the License:** Before your tool/plugin can be published, you must agree to the terms of our **Exclusive Content License Agreement**. This is the legal contract that governs our relationship.

5.  **Get Published & Earn!** Once approved, your tool/plugin will be listed in the Store, available for discovery and installation by server operators and AI agents worldwide.

### The Business Model: A Transparent Partnership

Our compensation model is designed to be a fair partnership. Here’s how it works:

1.  **Aura Friday takes a 35% Platform Fee** from the gross (pre-tax) list price of your tool/plugin. This fee covers our platform's development, security auditing, marketing, and support.

2.  **You receive the rest, after costs.** From the remaining 65%, we deduct all other costs of the transaction (like tax, compliance, anti-fraud, and payment processing fees). The entire remaining amount is your royalty.

**In simple terms: Your Royalty = (List Price) - (Our 35% Fee) - (Payment etc Fees).**

**Payouts & Terms:**
*   **99-Day Hold:** To protect against fraud, all royalties are subject to a 99-day holding period.
*   **KYC is Mandatory for Payout:** To comply with global financial regulations, you must successfully complete our Know Your Customer (KYC) identity verification process before any royalties can be paid out.
*   **Forfeiture:** Royalties are forfeited if KYC is not completed within 180 days of your first royalty being earned.

A detailed breakdown of the calculation is available in our full [Royalty Policy](ROYALTY_POLICY.md).
