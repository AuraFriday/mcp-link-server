### 2. IMPORTANT: Acknowledgement of Inherent Risks of Agentic AI, and your Duties

**mcp-link-server is a powerful tool that enables artificial intelligence agents to execute commands, access files, and perform real-world actions on your local machine. The use of such technology carries inherent and significant risks.**

By accepting this EULA, you expressly acknowledge, understand, and agree to the following:

a. **Risk of Catastrophic Failure:** AI agents can make mistakes. These mistakes can result in, but are not limited to, **permanent data loss, file corruption, unauthorized financial transactions, incorrect information being sent on your behalf, and other unintended and potentially irreversible actions.**

b. **You Assume All Risk:** You voluntarily and knowingly assume all risks associated with using the Software. You agree that you are solely responsible and liable for any and all outcomes that result from any action taken, or any decision made, by an AI agent through the Software.

c. **Your Responsibility to Mitigate:** You represent and warrant that you will take all necessary precautions to protect your systems and data. This includes, but is not limited to:-
  - i. **Supervising intended AI Actions** (e.g. read the intended AI's action *before* clicking the Allow button, and using the Deny feature when appropriate)
  - ii.  **Maintaining regular, independent backups** of all important data.
  - iii. **Running tools in sandboxed environments** (like Docker) where appropriate.
  - iv. **Carefully reviewing permissions** before granting an AI access to any tool or system.
  - v. **Never using the Software for critical operations without adequate supervision and fail-safes.**
