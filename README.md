- Connect any MCP-compatible client to your server's SSE endpoint
- Use tools directly from supported AI applications

> 🛠️ The server provides powerful local tools including file operations, system commands, browser automation, Docker sandboxing, and more.

---

## 🧠 What Is MCP?

**MCP** stands for **Model Context Protocol** — a standardized interface that allows AI agents to discover and execute tools on local servers.

**MCP Link Server** implements the server side of this protocol, providing:

* **Tool Discovery**: Advertises available tools and their capabilities to AI clients
* **Secure Execution**: Runs tools in controlled environments with user permissions; e.g. (`<antml:function_calls>`)
* **Real-time Communication**: Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for responsive AI interactions
* **Extensible Architecture**: Supports plugins, Docker sandboxing, and custom tool development

This gives AI models **real-world capabilities** — file access, system operations, browser control, and more — **without cloud dependencies**, **without vendor lock-in**, and with **complete local control**.

---

## 🔐 Designed for Enterprise-Grade Trust

MCP Link is built for safe, auditable real-world AI action.

* 🧠 **Agents can only see tools you’ve approved**
* 🛑 **AIs cannot call any tool unless you’ve explicitly enabled it**
* 🧮 **Every call can prompt for user approval, unless you override it**
* 🧱 **Supports sandboxing via Docker for isolated tool environments**
* 📜 **Logs every tool request, tool response, and agent call**

Whether you’re letting ChatGPT rename a folder, wanting Gemini to book you a hotel, or asking Claude to run semantic SQL queries, MCP Link ensures you stay in control — every step of the way.

## ⚙️ How It Works

MCP Link Server provides a powerful tool execution environment that connects to AI clients:

**Direct MCP Integration:**
* Any MCP-compatible client can connect to the server's SSE endpoint
* AI applications like Claude Desktop, VS Code extensions, and custom integrations
* Direct tool discovery and execution without browser dependencies

**Browser Integration (via MCP Link Extension):**
* [ChatGPT.com](https://chatgpt.com), [claude.ai](https://claude.ai), and other web-based AI services
* [gemini.google.com/app](https://gemini.google.com/app), [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai), [x.com/i/grok](https://x.com/i/grok) (coming soon)
* The server's "browser" tool enables web automation through the connected extension

The server exposes its tool capabilities through a standardized MCP interface, allowing AIs to discover and execute approved tools with full user control.

---

## 🧩 What Tools Does This Server Provide?

MCP Link Server hosts a comprehensive suite of tools that AI agents can discover and execute through the MCP protocol.

Tools are accessed via standard MCP function calls and executed in controlled environments on your local machine — but **only with explicit user permissions and approval**.

---

### 🛡️ User-Controlled Tool Access & Security

MCP Link Server provides **complete tool-level control to the user**.

Every tool execution goes through a comprehensive security process:

| Control Layer             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧩 **Tool Visibility**    | Users can enable or disable each tool via server configuration. Only enabled tools are advertised to AI clients. Disabled tools are entirely invisible.                                                                                                                                                        |
| ✅ **Execution Approval** | For enabled tools, the server can be configured with three access policies:<br> - **Ask every time** — require confirmation before each tool execution<br> - **Allow automatically** — execute trusted tools without prompts<br> - **Sandbox only** — only allow execution in Docker containers or restricted environments |

These settings are stored **per tool** in the server configuration and can be managed through the admin interface or configuration files.

---

🔄 Tool definitions, capabilities, and security policies are managed by:

**Built-in Tools**: Core tools are embedded in the server codebase for security and reliability
**Plugin System**: Additional tools can be loaded from verified plugin modules  
**Remote Manifest**: Optional tool updates and new capabilities from [https://cdn.aurafriday.com/config.json](https://cdn.aurafriday.com/config.json)

The server only advertises tools that are explicitly enabled and can **never execute tools without proper authorization**.

---

🔐 This permission architecture ensures:

* AIs can **never execute tools you haven't explicitly enabled**
* Every tool execution can be **logged, audited, and reviewed**
* Sensitive operations can be **sandboxed in Docker containers**
* **Zero-trust security** with granular permission controls

---

> ✅ This MCP server **runs locally** for maximum privacy and control — your data never leaves your machine.
> 🛠️ Advanced users can integrate with remote tool providers for extended capabilities.

---
